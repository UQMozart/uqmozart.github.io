						<h3>Projector Calibration</h3>
						<p>
							To begin, place the projector box roughly 5cm behind the back support beam of MozART. If the projector doesn't fully cover the screen from this distance, slide the box back. Ideally there should be some of the projection the the sides of the frame, with minimal shadow on the bottom border of the spandex. There should also be a tiny portion of the image which overshoots the top of the frame. This is ideal, as this area will be where the taskbar and window frame will sit, which we do not want to show on the screen.
						</p>
						<p>
							To ensure that the MozART experience is as seemless as possible, it's recommended that the taskbar be at the top of the screen and set to auto-hide (as pictured below).
							<br/>

							<br/>
							Ideally, this setup should ensure that only the MSAFluid window is displayed on the spandex screen.
						<p>
							<b>Troubleshooting:</b>
							<p>
								If the image appears tilted, check that the box and projector are both parallel to the rear support beam of MozART. If the image is still tilted, check that the feet of the projector (located at the front centre, and rear left and right corners of the device) are all set to the same height. If neither of these steps fix this problem, press the button on the projector immediately above the circular enter button. This will open a menu which will allow you to manipulate the image a reasonable amount.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the image appears blurry, adjust the keystone until the image comes into focus. This may also be an issue with the computer's resolution. Take note of the resolution that the computer was set to before adjusting the image, as it may have been set to that particular size for the MSAFluid canvas.
							</p>

						<h3>Speaker Requirements + Setup</h3>
						<p>
							Setting up the audio component of the MozART device can vary greatly depending on the context. As MozART is heavily dependant on the users being able to clearly hear the sounds being generated, it is recommended that it either be connected directly to studio monitors, or into a sound system. It has been noted that audio problems may occur if the computer is directly plugged into the audio system of your choice. As such, we recommend sending the signal through an amplifier before it reaches the speakers.
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<i>
								<b>Before you begin:</b>
								<li>Ableton Live will not be able to find the speakers if they are connected after the application is opened. Save yourself a headache and test that the device is working using Windows' sound control panel, before setting up Live.</li>
								<li>Speakers must be the last device turned on and the first device turned off. This is to ensure that there is little to no static in the signal which may cause the speakers to blow out while setting up.</li>
								<li>If possible, set the amplifier gain to -inf dB (may also be written as 0, depending on device) before beginning. Again, this is largely to ensure that you don't blow out the speakers.</li>
								</i>
							</ul>

						<h4>Connecting to a Mixer (UQ Touch Ensemble)</h4>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<b>Audio Devices required:</b>								
								<li>
									Two Direct Boxes <a href="https://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Signal-Processors/DI-Boxes/DI100/p/P0062#">(We used these ones)</a>
								</li>
								<li>
									3.5mm Male to twin XLR Male cable
								</li>
								<li>
									Two Female XLR to Male XLR cables
								</li>
							</ul>

						</p>
						<p>
							<b><i>Notes on this layout:</i></b><br/>
							<i>Before beginning, it's recommended that you check with the audio engineer what kind of cables the mixer requires. They also may be able to source the audio devices (or suitable alternatives) that you need.</i>
						</p>
						<h4>Connecting to Studio Monitors (Standalone Performance)</h4>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<b>Audio Devices required:</b>								
								<li>
									A small headphone amplifer <a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/headphones-dj/accessories/behringer/behringer-ha400-4-channel-headphone-amplifier/990400/">(We used this one)</a>
								</li>
								<li>
									Auxillary cable (3.5mm Male to 3.5mm Male)
								</li>
								<li>
									Two 3.5mm Female to 6.5mm Male adaptors
								</li>
								<li>
									3.5mm Male to twin XLR Male cable
								</li>
								<li>
									Two powered studio monitors (With XLR input)
								</li>
							</ul>
							<b>Signal Flow Diagram:</b><br/>
							<img src="images/mixerdiagram.png" width="75%"/>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b><i>Notes on this layout:</i></b><br/>
							<i>You may need to use a second powerboard for this setup, as both the speakers and the amplifier require AC power.<br/>
							Before you power anything on, double check that the auxillary cable (with 6.5mm adaptor) from the computer is plugged into the input port on the amplifier, and the output port of choice is set to 0. Again, this is just a precaution to avoid damaging the speakers.</i>
