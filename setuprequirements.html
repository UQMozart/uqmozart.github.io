						<p>
							To begin, place the projector box roughly 5cm behind the back support beam of MozART. If the projector doesn't fully cover the screen from this distance, slide the box back. Ideally there should be some of the projection the the sides of the frame, with minimal shadow on the bottom border of the spandex. There should also be a tiny portion of the image which overshoots the top of the frame. This is ideal, as this area will be where the taskbar and window frame will sit, which we do not want to show on the screen.
						</p>
						<p>
							To ensure that the MozART experience is as seemless as possible, it's recommended that the taskbar be at the top of the screen and set to auto-hide (as pictured below).
							<br/>
							<img src="images/lockthetaskbar.png" alt="Taskbar properties"/>
							<br/>
							Ideally, this setup should ensure that only the MSAFluid window is displayed on the spandex screen.
						<p>
							<b>Troubleshooting:</b>
							<p>
								If the image appears tilted, check that the box and projector are both parallel to the rear support beam of MozART. If the image is still tilted, check that the feet of the projector (located at the front centre, and rear left and right corners of the device) are all set to the same height. If neither of these steps fix this problem, press the button on the projector immediately above the circular enter button. This will open a menu which will allow you to manipulate the image a reasonable amount.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the image appears blurry, adjust the keystone until the image comes into focus. This may also be an issue with the computer's resolution. Take note of the resolution that the computer was set to before adjusting the image, as it may have been set to that particular size for the MSAFluid canvas.
							</p>

						<h2 id="speaker">Speaker Requirements + Setup</h2>
						<p>
							Setting up the audio component of the MozART device can vary greatly depending on the context. As MozART is heavily dependant on the users being able to clearly hear the sounds being generated, it is recommended that it either be connected directly to studio monitors, or into a sound system. It has been noted that audio problems may occur if the computer is directly plugged into the audio system of your choice. As such, we recommend sending the signal through an amplifier before it reaches the speakers.
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<i>
								<b id="audiotroubshoo">Before you begin:</b>
								<li>Ableton Live will not be able to find the speakers if they are connected after the application is opened. Save yourself a headache and test that the device is working using Windows' sound control panel, before setting up Live.</li>
								<li>Speakers must be the last device turned on and the first device turned off. This is to ensure that there is little to no static in the signal which may cause the speakers to blow out while setting up.</li>
								<li>If possible, set the amplifier gain to -inf dB (may also be written as 0, depending on device) before beginning. Again, this is largely to ensure that you don't blow out the speakers.</li>

						<h4>Connecting to a Mixer (UQ Touch Ensemble)</h4>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<b>Audio Devices required:</b>								
								<li>
									Two Direct Boxes <a href="https://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Signal-Processors/DI-Boxes/DI100/p/P0062#">(We used these ones)</a>
								</li>
								<li>
									3.5mm Male to twin XLR Male cable
								</li>
								<li>
									Two Female XLR to Male XLR cables
								</li>
							</ul>

							<img src="images/mixerdiagram2.png" width="75%"/>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b><i>Notes on this layout:</i></b><br/>
							<i>Before beginning, it's recommended that you check with the audio engineer what kind of cables the mixer requires. They also may be able to source the audio devices (or suitable alternatives) that you need.</i>
						</p>
						<h4>Connecting to Studio Monitors (Standalone Performance)</h4>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<b>Audio Devices required:</b>								
								<li>
									A small headphone amplifer <a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/headphones-dj/accessories/behringer/behringer-ha400-4-channel-headphone-amplifier/990400/">(We used this one)</a>
								</li>
								<li>
									Auxillary cable (3.5mm Male to 3.5mm Male)
								</li>
								<li>
									Two 3.5mm Female to 6.5mm Male adaptors
								</li>
								<li>
									3.5mm Male to twin XLR Male cable
								</li>
								<li>
									Two powered studio monitors (With XLR input)
								</li>
							</ul>
							<b>Signal Flow Diagram:</b><br/>
							<img src="images/mixerdiagram.png" width="75%"/>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b><i>Notes on this layout:</i></b><br/>
							<i>You may need to use a second powerboard for this setup, as both the speakers and the amplifier require AC power.<br/>
							Before you power anything on, double check that the auxillary cable (with 6.5mm adaptor) from the computer is plugged into the input port on the amplifier, and the output port of choice is set to 0. Again, this is just a precaution to avoid damaging the speakers.</i>

						<h2 id="live">Ableton Live Setup</h2>

						<p>
							<i id="here">Download the Live 9 project files we used for MozART<a href="">here</a></i>
							<h4><i>Before you begin:</i></h4>
							You will need to ensure that you have installed both the <a href="http://www.asio4all.com/" alt="Audio Stream Input/Output not Australian Security Intelligence Organisation">ASIO4All</a> driver and <a href="http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html">loopMIDI</a>. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							In order to connect the Processing Sketch to Ableton Live, you will need to set up loopMIDI as below:
							<br/>
							<img src="images/loopmidi.png"/>
						</p>
						<p>
							<h4>Calibrating MIDI Ports</h4>
							<i><a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/routing-and-i-o/#monitoring">For an indepth guide on Routing and I/O in Live, click here.</a></i> 
							<br/><br/>
							<b>Step 1)</b>
							Within Live, open the Preferences menu (ctrl +). Select the Link/MIDI tab and set as below:
							<br/>
							<img src="images/pref.png"/>
							<br/>
							Once these settings are correct, close the Preferences menu.
							<br/><br/><b>Step 2)</b>
							Ensure that you are both in <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/session-view/">Session View</a> and have the In/Out section toggled on. To switch between Session and Arrangement view, press tab. To toggle In/Out, click the I.O button on the bottom right of the window. 
							<br/><br/><b>Step 3)</b>
							For each of the six instrument channels, select the respective loopMIDI device in the MIDI From drop down menu. You don't need to change any other settings in this section, though you can change Monitor to "In" if Live appears to be sending data back to the loopMIDI device causing it to slow down.
							<br/><br/><b>Step 4)</b>
							Finally, arm each MIDI device by ctrl clicking on each track's <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/recording-new-clips/#arming-record-enabling-tracks">arm button</a>. 
							<br/><br/>
							After following these steps, your Session should look like this:
							<br/>
							<img src="images/armed.png">
						</p>
						<p>
							<h4>Mapping MIDI</h4>
							<i>If you are using the project files as linked <a href="#here">above</a>, you can skip this process, as the document is already set up for the loopMIDI devices.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Before you begin, open setMIDIMaps.pde which should be contained in a folder titled setMIDIMaps. This particular sketch spoofs the MIDI data which would be sent to Live during a MozART performance allowing you to accurately map particular data points to variables within Live. If you are building the instrument from scratch it is strongly recommended that you highlight values that you wish to change by placing the devices in either an instrument rack or an effect rack, with each particular value mapped to a macro. <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/instrument-drum-and-effect-racks/"><i>To find out more about Instrument, Drum and Effect Racks, click here.</i></a>
						</p>
						<p>

						</p>
						<p>
							<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
							If there is a massive delay between sending MIDI to Live and it generating sound, you may need to change the audio drivers from MME/DirectX to ASIO. If Live isn't generating sound while on the ASIO drivers, ensure that you followed <a href="#audiotroubshoo"><i>Before You Begin</i></a> in the Speaker Setup section. If you have, and Live is still not playing audio, open ASIO4All settings and turn off every device except the speakers. <a href="https://www.image-line.com/support/FLHelp/html/envsettings_asio4all.htm">Image-Line has a reasonably good resource which explains the ASIO4All interface.</a>
							<br/>
							If the Audio is crackling, there may be an issue with the latency within Live. To fix this, you will need to fiddle with the input buffer size to reach a point where the audio isn't massively delayed as well as not crackling. <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/midi-fact-sheet/#tips-for-achieving-optimal-midi-performance">These are Ableton's suggestions for optimising audio quality with MIDI</a>
