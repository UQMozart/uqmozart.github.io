						<h2>An inter-faculty relationship in the making</h2>
						<p>It was decided at the completion of Semester 1 of 2016 that there was definite potential to develop the MozART installation further. Discussions at the DECO3850 showcase with Dr Eve Klein of the School of Music led to a proposed collaboration with UQ’s newly established Touch Ensemble. The work done in Semester 1 was used as a starting point for a new direction in development, with the assistance of ensemble members in the ideation process and observations of their interactions within the ensemble. This was then used to inform the next iteration of MozART, culminating in a feature piece in the Touch Ensemble’s concert performance on the 25th of October, 2016.</p>

						<p>The purpose of this collaboration was to establish a connection between the Music and Information Technology faculties, and allow exploration of emerging musical technologies as well as development of new ones. This project is likely to be the first of many future collaborations between the two faculties.

						<h2>Exploring using iPads as instruments</h2>
						<p>As written in the lunchtime concert programme by Dr Chris Perren: <i>“Touch Ensemble is an exploratory group, working with instruments and media that have no dedicated repertoire or established performance practice. We use iPads, MIDI keyboards, and laptops alongside traditional instruments and voices, connected and amplified via wired and wireless analogue and digital means to explore the music-making capabilities of these technologies. The ensemble was established by Dr Eve Klein as part of her groundbreaking research into music technology and education.”</i></p>

						<p><i>“One of the greatest challenges of working with iPads and other digital instruments is the limitless possibility. Unlike traditional instruments which have well-defined boundaries and norms, each iPad contains a multitude of diverse instruments (apps) which can be connected in a multitude of ways to other devices, media, and instruments. It is easy to get paralysed by the abundance of choice. But in taking on this challenge, we can help to shape an emerging performance practice for these instruments, as they become more and more widespread in music performance and education.”</i></p>

						<h2>More Information</h2>
						<p>For more information about the Touch Ensemble, feel free to contact the UQ School of Music (See: <a href="https://music.uq.edu.au/">https://music.uq.edu.au/</a>) or email Dr Chris Perren at <a>c.perren1@uq.edu.au</a> . It is anticipated that the Touch Ensemble will return in Semester 1 of 2017, to welcome both new and returning members.</p>
