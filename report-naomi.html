						<h3>Abstract</h3>
						<p>This report aims to investigate the role of sound design in the context of physical computing, particularly in the growing physical Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) controller sphere. In particular, this report will look at how this plays into the design of MozART; a large X/Y pad style instrument developed at the University of Queensland. In particular, this report will investigate a variety of approaches taken by MIDI developers in creating both musical installations and electronic instruments in creating both predictable and playful audio output. It was discovered that as MIDI as a platform allows users to endlessly customise how each device interacts with sound, the way each device allows the player to perform varies depending on the user’s personal preference. </p>

						<h3>MozART's Sound Design</h3>
						<p>
							MozART was initially developed as an installation which would allow users with little to no musical experience a platform to explore creating consistently sonically pleasing music. As we wanted to limit the chances that the users would create a sound that they would find abhorrent, we opted to make the instrument more of an effect rack (manipulating the sound instead of producing from scratch). We discovered that by limiting the amount of control users had over the sound itself resulted in most users being reasonably unaware they were changing anything in particular regarding the sound. As such we decided that any future iterations would need to have a much more involved musical component.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the second iteration, we became more concerned about developing MozART as a standalone instrument of sorts, allowing more advanced users to explore musical performance outside the space of an analogue instrument. As we were developing this alongside the UQ Touch Ensemble, we tried to model the sonic component on the kinds of instruments they were drawn to throughout the rehearsal phase. Reasonably early in the development, we noted that a reasonable number of participants were classical musicians with little experience in digital music production. We were also reasonably concerned with producing sounds which matched the visuals and the semiotics of the structure itself. Given that we had received a fair amount of positive feedback regarding the visual component during the first iteration, it was decided reasonably early on that the instrument would retain the MSAFluid style visuals. 
						</p>
						<p>
							From this, we were able to determine a few key areas which would guide the overall sound design of the instrument:
							<ul>
								<li>The instrument would be in the bass clef, as both musicians and listeners have come to expect that large instruments are located in that vocal range.</li>
								<li>The instrument would need to sound somewhat similar to an instrument the performers were familiar with in the context of classical music.</li>
								<li>The instrument would need to have an ethereal vibe, as it was noted that the visuals created an effect similar to Van Gogh’s Starry Night.</li>
							</ul>
							Using these key points as a guide, we produced a sound similar to a double bass, which we felt fit these three rules reasonably well.
